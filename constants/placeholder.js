Mark in a simple browser based markdown editor with simplistic features any developer could implement , though the point is to be fast and aesthetically pleasing.

## Features

- Export documents 
- Dark Mode (not really a feature but since everyone adds it in their feature list...)
- Simplistic as hell

## Support 
You don't have to but it's be nice if  you bought me a coffee. It's pretty easy to do.
