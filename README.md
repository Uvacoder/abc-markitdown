## Motivation

Simple Markdown editor built with syntax highlighting and an optional preview that I mostly use for my work. I don't like the apps that exist and are mostly pretty memory heavy, on the other hand the web app is pretty simple and suffices most of what I use Markdown for

## Features

- System Controlled Dark Mode
- Export the raw .md file
- Optional Preview

## TODO

- Browser storage (store the currently entered text in the browser)

## Contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to fork the project and raise PR's. Though, do inform the mainter as to what issue you pick up to avoid overlaps
