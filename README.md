<h1 align="center">Mark</h1>
<p align="center">Web Markdown Editor </p>

Simple Markdown editor built with syntax highlighting and an optional preview that I mostly use for my work. 
I don't like the apps that exist and are mostly pretty memory heavy, on the other hand the web app is pretty simple and suffices most of what I use Markdown for.
